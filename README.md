# Layoffs-EDA-and-Prediction
Conducted a comprehensive EDA to identify seasonal patterns in layoffs and developed an ARIMA model with an MAPE of 0.37 to accurately forecast future layoff events. The model was able to provide 6 months of advance warning, allowing the company to implement cost-saving measures and reduce the impact of layoffs.
